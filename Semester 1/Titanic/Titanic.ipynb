    "# My question was whether people who had family members aboard were more or less likely to survive.\n",
    "# I think an observational study is more fit to this, specifically a retrospective study.\n",
    "# I will use a census, as we will need to collect data from every passenger in order to answer this question.\n",
    "# We can look at each passenger, and perform a simple logical check to make two groups depending on if each passenger had family aboard.\n",
    "# This can be done using the SibSp (siblings/spouses aboard) and Parch (parents/children aboard) columns.\n",
    "# Then, we can look at the Survived column to see which group was more likely to survive."
