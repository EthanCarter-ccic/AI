    "# What is the probability that the first hand dealt in a game of Blackjack sums to 21?\n",
    "# The theoretical probability for this is about 4.83%.\n",
    "# This is because a 21 is achievable via being dealt an ace (worth 11) and a card worth 10 (king, queen, jack, or 10).\n",
    "# There are 4 aces in a deck, and 4 of each of the cards worth 10.\n",
    "# Because 2 cards are dealt initially, we need to calculate ace-first and 10-first probabilities.\n",
    "# Ace-first: 4/52 x 16/51 = 64/2652\n",
    "# 10-first: 16/52 x 4/51 = 64/2652\n",
